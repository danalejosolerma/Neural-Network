# Neural network
In this code there implemented a neural network by hand (no ML libraries). It can generate neural networks with different numbers of layers and nodes. It minimizes the MSE by using gradient descent. It is implemented with a sigmoid function as activation function. To test the code, it was considered IRIS data.

The Iris data consists of 3 different types of irisesâ€™ (Setosa, Versicolour, and Virginica) petal and sepal length, stored in a 150x4 array. The accuracy with the Neural network proposed achieved 80%
