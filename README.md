# Neural network
In this code it was implemented a neural network from scratch (no ML libraries). It can generate neural networks with different numbers of layers and nodes. It minimizes the mean square error (MSE) by using gradient descent.  In addition, it is implemented with a sigmoid function as activation function. To test the code, it was considered IRIS data.

The Iris data consists of 3 different types of irisesâ€™ (Setosa, Versicolour, and Virginica) petal and sepal length, stored in a 150x4 array. The accuracy with the Neural network proposed achieved 100% with the test set
